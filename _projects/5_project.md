## Executive Summary
### Primary Goal
The main goal is to develop a functional and visually engaging Excel dashboard that analyses four years of transactional sales data from Adventure Works. It focuses on refining data interpretation skills, enhancing storytelling through visualisations, and applying structured methodologies for business insight generation. The dashboard is designed to highlight key performance patterns and support data-informed decision-making.


### Solution
This project delivers a comprehensive Excel dashboard tailored for sales data analysis using the Adventure Works dataset. Through a guided methodology, the dashboard offers:
- Visual representations of profit trends across products, regions, and time periods.
- Interactive features that allow users to filter and explore data dynamically.
- Structured insights to support business-oriented decision-making.
- A clear demonstration of analytical thinking and visualisation techniques in Excel.

### Key Findings
- Consistent Growth: Revenue increased steadily, peaking at over $101M in 2007 and 2008.
- Product Profitability: Premium items (priced above $150), particularly Road-150 Red and Mountain-200, consistently drove high profits.
- Seasonal Peaks: Profit concentration occurred mid-year (May–June) and year-end (October–December), varying by year.
- Weekday Advantage: Weekdays contributed more than 70% of profit across all four years, with Thursday ranking in the top 3 every year.
- Customer Drivers: The 50+ age group generated nearly half of total customer profit, and gender impact was nearly balanced.
- Geographic Focus: Australia and the United States accounted for over 60% of total profit.

### Recommendations
- Optimise Product Strategy: Prioritise high-margin items and streamline low-performing SKUs (Stock Keeping Unit).
- Align Campaign Timing: Schedule marketing around seasonal and weekday profit peaks.
- Enhance Customer Segmentation: Target older customers with tailored promotions and loyalty benefits.
- Expand Regional Efforts: Invest further in high-performing markets like Australia and the U.S.
- Reward Top Customers: Establish retention programmes for high-profit individual buyers.

## Introduction
### Business Problem
Adventure Works, a multinational retail company, manages a diverse product portfolio across several global regions. However, the organisation faces challenges in identifying key profit drivers and regional performance disparities over time. Without a cohesive and accessible method for analysing historical sales data, stakeholders struggle to make informed decisions regarding product strategy, regional investment, and seasonal demand planning. This project addresses the need for a visually intuitive dashboard that consolidates four years of transactional data, enabling clearer insight into sales trends and unlocking opportunities for data-driven decision-making.

### Goals
- Summarise Multi-Year Sales Performance: Present a high-level overview of Adventure Works' sales trends over a four-year period to help users quickly grasp historical performance.
- Highlight Profit Drivers by Category and Region: Identify which product categories and geographical markets contributed most significantly to revenue generation.
- Enable Dynamic Data Exploration: Integrate interactive Excel features (e.g. slicers, filters) to allow users to customise views and explore specific timeframes, regions, or product groups.
- Reveal Seasonal and Temporal Patterns: Analyse time-based trends to uncover seasonal spikes or declines in sales, guiding future planning and promotional activities.
- Support Strategic Decision-Making: Provide actionable insights through visualisations that help stakeholders evaluate investment, inventory, and marketing strategies.
- Create a Visually Intuitive Dashboard Experience: Ensure the layout is clean, coherent, and easily navigable—making the dashboard approachable for users with varying data literacy levels.
