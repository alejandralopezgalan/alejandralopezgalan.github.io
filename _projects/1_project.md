## Executive Summary
The primary goal of this project was to establish a comprehensive system for monitoring key HR metrics and employee performance. Secondary to this, the project aimed to identify the primary factors influencing employee attrition within the organisation.

By analysing various employee and company data points, I was able to uncover significant insights into the drivers of turnover.

### Key Findings

- The majority of employees are between 20 and 29 years old, and currently the company, Atlas Labs, employs 2.7% more women than men, with a total of 1233 active employees.
- Employees who identify as non-binary make up 8.5% of total employees.
- Employes who identify as white have the highest average salary, whereas mixed or multiple ethnic groups have one pf the lowest average salaries. 
- The attrition rate is 16.1% and the department and job role with the highest attrition rate is Sales and Sales Representative, respectively.
- Departmental disparities: Sale consistently experienced higher turnover rates than other departments.
- Managerial rating level and self-performance level do not always align.
