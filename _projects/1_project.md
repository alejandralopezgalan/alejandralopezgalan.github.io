## Executive Summary
### Primary Goal
To analyse Human Resources (HR) metrics and employee performance to identify attrition drivers.

### Key Findings
- __Demographics:__ The majority of employees are between 20 and 29 years old, with a slightly higher proportion (2.7%) of women than men.
- __Attrition:__ The overall attrition rate is 16.1% with Sales Representative roles experiencing the highest turnover.
- __Performance:__ Managerial rating level and self-performance level do not always align. 

### Recommendations

- __Targeted retention programmes:__ Implement specific retention initiatives for departments with high turnover, such as Sales.
- __Employee Satisfaction Initiatives:__ Enhance employee satisfaction through recognition programs, flexible work arrangements, and improved communication.
- __Managerial Development:__ Provide training and support to managers to improve their leadership skills and create a positive work environment.
- __Compensation and Benefits Review:__ Regularly review compensation and benefits packages to ensure they remain competitive.

By implementing these recommendations, Atlas Labs can significantly reduce employee turnover, improve morale, and enhance overall organisational performance.

## Introduction

### Business Problem
Atlas Labs is facing a significant challenge with employee turnover, which is negatively impacting productivity, morale, and the bottom line. Understanding the underlying causes of attrition is crucial for developing effective retention strategies.

### Goals
1. Identify the primary factors contributing to employee turnover.
2. Develop targeted retention strategies to address these factors.
3. Improve overall employee satisfaction and engagement.

## Methodology

### Data Source
The analysis is based on HR data from Atlas Labs, covering demographics, tenure, salary, performance reviews, and attrition information for 1470 employees. Datasets were obtained through [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/users/sign_in?redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fapp.datacamp.com%2Flearn)

### Tools and Techniques
Power BI, DAX functions, Data Modelling, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

### Data Understanding
Atlas Labs is a fictitious software company. To perform the analysis I used HR records that consisted of five tables:  `EducationLevel`, `Employee`, `RatingLevel`, `SatisfiedLevel`, and `PerformanceRating`. For more details of each dataset review the [Metadata page](metadata.md).

### Data Cleaning
I initiated a new Power BI report and imported the five CSV datasets. To clarify the table roles, I prepended 'Fact' or 'Dim' to each table name, designating them as either fact or dimension tables. Next, I ensured that the columns were correctly formatted following the [Metadata information](metadata.md). 

### Data Transformation
I created a new date calculated table using the DAX code from [DimDate.txt](DimDate.txt) file.

{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" max-width="480px" max-heigth="720px" path="assets/img/project1-rename-columns.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %} 

<br/>Once the data was loaded and cleaned, I generated a data model to establish the relatioships between tables. This image shows the initial data model.

<br/>This image shows the final data model used for the analysis.

### DAX measures
I created a table with all the measures required for the analysis, and I used DAX formulas to create these measures.

| Measure | Description | DAX code |
| :--- | --- | :--- |
| `TotalEmployees` | The total count of the employees in the company | `TotalEmployees = DISTINCTCOUNT(DimEmployee[EmployeeID])` |
| `ActiveEmployees` | Active employees in the company | `ActiveEmployees = CALCULATE(COUNT(DimEmployee[EmployeeID]), FILTER(DimEmployee, DimEmployee[Attrition] = "No"))` |
| `InactiveEmployees` | Employees that left the company | `InactiveEmployees = CALCULATE(COUNT(DimEmployee[EmployeeID]), FILTER(DimEmployee, DimEmployee[Attrition] = "Yes"))` |
| `% Attrition Rate` | Percentage of Attrition Rate of the company | `% Attrition Rate = DIVIDE([InactiveEmployees], [TotalEmployees])` |
| `TotalEmployeesDate` | Count of total employees by date | `TotalEmployeesDate = CALCULATE([TotalEmployees], USERELATIONSHIP(DimDate[Date], DimEmployee[HireDate]))` |
| `AverageSalary` | Average salary for all employees | `AverageSalary = AVERAGE(DimEmployee[Salary])` |
| `FullName` | To get the full name of each employee | `CONCATENATE(DimEmployee[FirstName], CONCATENATE(" ", DimEmployee[LastName]))` |
| `LastReviewDate` | Displays the last performance review for the selected employee | `LastReviewDate = IF ( MAX ( FactPerformanceRating[ReviewDate] ) = BLANK(), "No Review Yet", MAX ( FactPerformanceRating[ReviewDate] ))` |
| `NextReviewDate` | Calculates when the next performance is due. It should be 365 days after the `LastReviewDate` | `NextReviewDate = VAR review = IF ( MAX ( FactPerformanceRating[ReviewDate] ) = BLANK (), MAX ( DimEmployee[HireDate] ),  MAX ( FactPerformanceRating[ReviewDate] )) RETURN review + 365` |
| `JobSatisfaction` | Gets the max level of employees' satisfaction with their job role. | `JobSatisfaction = MAX(FactPerformanceRating[JobSatisfaction])` |
| `EnvironmentSatisfaction` | Calculates the max rating of employees' satisfaction with their environment | `EnvironmentSatisfaction = CALCULATE ( MAX ( FactPerformanceRating[EnvironmentSatisfaction] ), USERELATIONSHIP ( FactPerformanceRating[EnvironmentSatisfaction], DimSatisfiedLevel[SatisfactionID] ) )` |
| `RelationshipSatisfaction` | Estimates the max level of employees' satisfaction with their relationships at work | `RelationshipSatisfaction = CALCULATE ( MAX (FactPerformanceRating[RelationshipSatisfaction] ), USERELATIONSHIP ( FactPerformanceRating[RelationshipSatisfaction] , DimSatisfiedLevel[SatisfactionID] ) )` |
| `WorkLifeBalance` | Measures the max level of employees' satisfaction with their work-life balance | `WorkLifeBalance = CALCULATE ( MAX (FactPerformanceRating[WorkLifeBalance]), USERELATIONSHIP ( FactPerformanceRating[WorkLifeBalance], DimSatisfiedLevel[SatisfactionID] ) ` |
| `Self_Rating` | Calculates the max rating of employees' performance based on their own view | `Self_Rating = CALCULATE ( MAX (FactPerformanceRating[SelfRating] ), USERELATIONSHIP ( FactPerformanceRating[SelfRating] , DimRatingLevel[RatingID] ))` |
| `Manager_Rating` | Estimates the max rating of employees' performance based on their managerâ€™s view | `Manager_Rating = CALCULATE ( MAX (FactPerformanceRating[ManagerRating]), USERELATIONSHIP ( FactPerformanceRating[ManagerRating] , DimRatingLevel[RatingID] ))` |
| `Inactive_Employees_Date` | Quantifies the number of inactive employees by date | `Inactive_Employees_Date = CALCULATE( [InactiveEmployees], USERELATIONSHIP ( DimDate[Date], DimEmployee[HireDate] ))` |
| `% Attrition Rate Date` | Calculates the rates of attrition base on inactive employees by date | `% Attrition Rate Date = DIVIDE([Inactive_Employees_Date], [TotalEmployeesDate])` |

### Data Analysis
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I used descriptive statistics and data visualisation to identify trends and patterns in the data.
- Key Metrics: Employee satisfaction, turnover rates, diversity indexes, and hiring trends were analysed.


### Data Visualisation
I created a report in Power BI to showcase the results of the analysis. 

_Overview_ provides a high-level summary of key metrics related to attrition at the company, including: 
- Total Employees: The overall number of employees (1470).
- Active and Inactive Employees: Breakdown of currently active (1233) and inactive employees (237).
- Employees by Department and Role: Distribution of active employees across different departments (Technology, Sales and HR) and roles.
- Attrition Rate: The percentage of employees leaving the company over a specific period (actual 16.1%).
- Hiring Trend by Year: The trend of employee hiring over the past years (2012 to 2022).

{% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/project1-overview.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %} 

The interactive elements of the Overview page in my Power BI report allow users to explore various metrics and trends related to employee attrition, such as: viewing the total number of employees and their status (active/inactive), exploring the distribution of employees by department and role, and analysing the attrition rate and observing hiring trends over the years.

{% include figure.liquid path="assets/video/project1_overview_video.gif" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %} 

<br/> _Demographics_ page includes key statistics such as:
- Age Distribution: Ranges from 18 to 51 years old, with the majority being 20-29 years old (874 employees).
- Marital Status: The largest group is single (624 employees, 42.45% of the total).
- Gender Distribution: The majority are females between 30 and 39 years old.
- Ethnicity: The highest number of employees are white, with an average salary around $110K.

{% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/project1-demographics.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %} 

The interactive features of the Demographics dashboard enable users to delve into various demographic metrics and gain detailed insights into employee data.

{% include figure.liquid path="assets/video/project1_demographics_video.gif" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %} 

<br/> _Performance Tracker_ is a page designed to visualise individual employee performance scores based on yearly performance reviews. The dashboard includes various elements such as:
- KPIs: Key Performance Indicators of individual scores on different criteria such as job satisfaction, environment satisfaction, relationships satisfaction, and work-life balance across multiple years.
- Review Records: Individual records of the start date (when the employee started working at the company), the date of the last review, and the due date for the next review.
- Comparison Charts: Visual comparisons of self-performance metrics and those by their management.

{% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/project1-performance.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %} 

Users can select an individual employee to view their specific performance scores and review records in detail.

{% include figure.liquid path="assets/video/project1_performance_video.gif" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %} 

<br/> _Attrition_ is a page that displays in-depth plots related to the company's attrition rate. The dashboard includes various elements such as:
- Overall Attrition Rate: The overall percentage of employees leaving the company (16.1%).
- Department and Job Role: Attrition rates segmented by different departments and job roles. The highest is Sales Representatives with 39.8%.
- Travel Frequency: Attrition rates based on employees' travel frequency. The highest are frequent travellers with 24.9%.
- Overtime Requirement: Attrition rates correlated with overtime work requirements. The highest (30.5%) for those with overtime requirements.
- Attrition by Hire Date: Analysis of attrition rates by employee hire dates. 2020 was the year with the highest rate (22.0%).
- Tenure: Breakdown of attrition rates based on employees' length of tenure at the company. The majority are employees with less than two years of tenure.

{% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/project1-attrition.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %} 

Users can interact with the dashboard to explore these metrics and gain detailed insights into employee turnover.

## Results and Implications
### Demographics
- The workforce is relatively young, with a majority of employees aged 20-29.
- While there is a gender imbalance, the company has a diverse workforce in terms of ethnicity.
- Employees who identify as white have the highest average salary, whereas mixed or multiple ethnic groups have one of the lowest average salaries

### Attrition:
- The overall attrition rate of 16.1% is higher than industry benchmarks ([Onsight Global](https://insightglobal.com/blog/employee-attrition-rate-how-to-calculate-improve/)).
- Sales and Sales Representative roles have significantly higher turnover rates, indicating potential issues with job satisfaction, work-life balance, or management.
- Frequent travelers and overtime workers are most likely to resign, as they have the highest attrition rate.

### Performance:
- A discrepancy between managerial ratings and self-performance ratings suggests potential misalignment in expectations or performance evaluation processes.

### Implications:
- High turnover rates can lead to increased costs, decreased productivity, and a negative impact on company culture.
- Addressing the root causes of attrition is essential for improving retention and creating a positive work environment.
