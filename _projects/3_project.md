> This project draws inspiration from Karina Samsonova's data portfolio work featured on her [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0I3HEnTAWk&ab_channel=KarinaDataScientist). Her comprehensive tutorial on building an interactive Excel dashboard provided exceptional guidance throughout my learning journey. I am profoundly grateful for Karina's expertise and generosity in sharing such valuable educational content.
