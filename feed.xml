The holiday season made it even more special, with festive markets and rich cultural experiences. I landed in Munich International Airport, where my partner picked me up, and we took the train to Deggendorf, where we stay for the two weeks I had for holidays. She was already living there for a couple of months, and thankfully she knew how to move around the area and helped me getting everything I needed for the holidays. One of the most memorable parts of my trip was visiting the famous Christmas markets. It was my first time experiencing them, and honestly, words cannot describe how much I loved them. The first Christmas market I went to was in Deggendorf, it was small but beautiful. I indulged in Baumstriezel filled with chocolate and a sweet cinnamon top, and mulled wine (Glühwein). After that day, I had Glühwein in every Christmas market I visited.</p> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blog2-deggendorf-market-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blog2-deggendorf-market-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blog2-deggendorf-market-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/blog2-deggendorf-market.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blog2-deggendorf-market-view-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blog2-deggendorf-market-view-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blog2-deggendorf-market-view-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/blog2-deggendorf-market-view.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Enjoying baumstriezel and glühwein in Deggendorf Christmast market. </div> <p>We travelled by train everytime we went out, and I did enjoy the view during the trip.

We learnt about statistics and how to analyse biological data. As I conducted research for my honours thesis, I started developing my skills in R programming.</p> <p>I followed the research path and decided to pursue a PhD in visual ecology at the University of Queensland in Australia, where I further honed my data analysis, statistics, data visualisation, and R programming skills.</p> <p>I loved doing marine biology research in Australia; it was truly a privilege. I explored wonderful places during my studies and met amazing people. However, sometimes unexpected things happen, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and the plans you had can change without warning.</p> <p>I moved back to my home country, Mexico, and started over. I knew that as much as I loved doing research, it was not something I wanted to do for the rest of my career. Nonetheless, I needed a job, and I was lucky enough to find one within three months, starting as a teacher in a private high school.</p> <p>I began teaching Geography, then Ecology, and finally the elective Critical Thinking. I didn’t plan on teaching for long—maybe just one or two years—but once again, things didn’t go as expected, and here I am, four years into teaching.</p> <p>This job is demanding, but honestly, I got through a very difficult time thanks to my students. They might not know it, but showing up, talking to them, teaching them, and learning from them really helped me when I was going through an emotional rollercoaster. I should also thank my amazing therapist, who helped me when I felt lost. What I can tell you from this experience is to be kind to everyone; you don’t know what they are going through. Even when they seem happy, they might be fighting some emotional battles.</p> <p>Let’s go back to the main topic: why become a Data Analyst? Well, why not? As I mentioned before, I was fascinated by statistics since I was an undergrad. It was something that I was good at and quick to learn. I would say that if you study something related to natural science, you need to learn statistics. We use it to prove that the data from our experiments are reliable and might or might not be significant. Thanks to my formal education, I can confidently say that I am competent in data visualisation, spreadsheets, statistics, analysing data, R programming, data cleaning, and data collection.</p> <p>I could also say that my experience in teaching and supervising students, both at secondary and tertiary education levels, has helped me to develop some of the non-technical skills you need to be a good data analyst: problem-solving, communicating to diverse audiences, writing, attention to detail, and critical thinking.</p> <p>As I started to take my goal of becoming a Data Analyst more seriously, I decided to purchase a <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/">DataCamp</a> membership to learn some of the skills I needed, such as SQL and Data Visualisation in PowerBI and Tableau, and to brush up on my Spreadsheet skills. I know that there are free resources that you can find on YouTube and other places, but for me, it is best to find the information I need in one place, at least to know where to start.</p> <p>Then I started to listen to some podcasts on Spotify that talked about transitioning to a Data Analyst role, such as the <a href="https://datacareerpodcast.com/">Data Career Podcast</a> with Avery Smith, <a href="https://carrerascientificasalternativas.com/podcast-entrevistas/">Carreras Científicas Alternativas</a> (in Spanish) with Manolo Castellano, <a href="https://www.superdatascience.com/podcast">Super Data Science: ML &amp; AI Podcast with Jon Krohn</a> with Jon Krohn, and <a href="https://mavenanalytics.io/mavens-of-data">Mavens of Data</a> with the team from Maven Analytics. The more I got into it, the more I learnt that in order to land a job, I needed to work on my portfolio, build projects, and network. So here I am, it is almost the end of the year and I want to step up my game, and that is why I decided to work on my webpage, my portfolio, and be more active on LinkedIn.</p> <p>Thanks for reading this blog, and if you want to connect with me, you can find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alejandralopezgalan/">LinkedIn</a> or any of my socials.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blog1-workbiology-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blog1-workbiology-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blog1-workbiology-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/blog1-workbiology.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>Drying wetsuits after diving was part of the work as a marine biologist.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blog1-workbiology2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blog1-workbiology2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blog1-workbiology2-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/blog1-workbiology2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>Flying over the Great Barrier Reef is one of my favorite memories.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blog1-workbiology3.JPG-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blog1-workbiology3.JPG-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blog1-workbiology3.JPG-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/blog1-workbiology3.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>I’m very grateful for making friendships that last even after the PhD.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="career-transition"/><category term="data"/><category term="analytics"/><category term="teacher"/><category term="career"/><category term="change"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[How it all started]]></summary></entry></feed>
