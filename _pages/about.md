Hello. I am Alejandra. My background in marine biology ignited a fascination for the underwater world, and now I am channeling that passion into the world of data analytics.

As a marine researcher, I honed my data analysis and visualisation skills, transforming complex datasets into clear insights that guided research initiatives. This resulted in the creation of a novel method using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study the cuttlefish brain, leading to two prestigious peer-reviewed publications and presentations at five international scientific meetings.

I am currently actively learning and expanding my data analysis skillset through online courses and certifications in SQL, Excel, and PowerBI to gain the necessary expertise for a data analyst role.

I am eager to explore potential opportunities in the field. Feel free to reach out via email to connect and discuss my career goals
