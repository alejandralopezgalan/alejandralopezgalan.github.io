## My experience as a Teacher
The classroom is my stage, and my students are the audience. Each day, I strive to weave a captivating narrative, where every lesson is a chapter in their personal growth story. The joy of witnessing their "aha" moments, the spark in their eyes when they finally grasp a concept, and the thrill of igniting their mind is an unparalleled reward.

To accommodate diverse learning styles, I employ a variety of teaching methods, from storytelling to interactive presentations. My goal is to create engaging learning experiences for everyone.

While the fulfillment is vast, the challenges are equally daunting. The long hours spent grading assignments, the late nights preparing lessons, and the constant struggle to maintain a healthy work-life balance often take their toll. The meager compensation further adds to the strain, making it difficult to sustain the passion that initially drew me to this noble profession.

Yet, I persevere, driven by the belief that education is the cornerstone of progress. By fostering critical thinking and a love for learning, I hope to empower the next generation of informed and engaged citizens. Every day, I walk into my classroom, not just as a teacher, but as a mentor and a guide. As a geography, ecology, and critical thinking teacher, I have the privilege of sparking curiosity in young minds. Despite the challenges of balancing a demanding curriculum with individual student needs, I remain dedicated to providing a high-quality education.

### Geography
We begin the semester with Geography, a discipline that explores the Earth's surface, its features, inhabitants, and phenomena. We delve into the significance of geographical studies, particularly understanding the profound impact human societies have on the environment. We also examine the celestial bodies, the Moon and the Sun, and their vital role in sustaining life on Earth. By exploring Earth's movements, such as rotation and revolution, we gain insights into the consequences of these celestial mechanics. Finally, we discover how Human Geography illuminates the intricate relationship between societies and the natural world. 
I teach this class in Spanish.

Here are some slides I use to illustrate these topics in class.

### Critical Thinking
This elective English subject focuses on developing critical thinking skills. We learn to identify, analyse, and evaluate arguments and claims, recognise and overcome personal biases, construct persuasive arguments, and make informed decisions. Additionally, we acquire essential digital literacy skills, such as locating reliable information online and identifying logical fallacies.

To foster a collaborative and engaging learning environment, we participate in team-based trivia activities.
