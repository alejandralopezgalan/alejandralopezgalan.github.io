It's March 2025, and I've been wanting to write a blog about my past winter holidays in Germany, but work as a teacher hasn't let me much spare time to continue on my blog, nonetheless, I finally organise my day to write, and here I am.

In December 2024, I had the incredible opportunity to visit Germany for the first time. The holiday season made it even more special, with festive markets and rich cultural experiences. 
I landed in Munich International Airport, where my partner picked me up, and we took the train to Deggendorf, where we stay for the two weeks I had for holidays. She was already living there for a couple of months, and thankfully she knew how to move around the area and helped me getting everything I needed for the holidays.
One of the most memorable parts of my trip was visiting the famous Christmas markets. It was my first time experiencing them, and honestly, words cannot describe how much I loved them. The first Christmas market I went to was in Deggendorf, it was small but beautiful. I indulged in Baumstriezel filled with chocolate and a sweet cinnamon top, and mulled wine (Gl端hwein). After that day, I had Gl端hwein in every Christmas market I visited.

We travelled by train everytime we went out, and I did enjoy the view during the trip. It was relaxing and although my German language knowledge was almost zero, my partner did a superb job to get us anywhere we needed to be. However, I didn't like that the trains were not always in time, aren't Germans known by their punctuality?

Passau was the second city we visited, and in the Christmas market, there was a kissing station, and to keep up with the tradition, my partner and I kissed under the mistletoe.

The third place we visited was Regensburg. We took a bus to visit the Walhalla temple, which resembles the Parthenon in Athens. The temple and the view were majestic, and so was St. Peter Cathedral with its gothic architectural style.

The next city we visited was Salzburg. We had the chance to visit the Hohensalzburg Fortress, one of the largest and oldest museum for art and cultural history in Salzburg. It is a must place to visit if you are someone who enjoys learning about history, medieval collections, and war.
