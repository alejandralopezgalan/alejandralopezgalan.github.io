Hello, my name is Alejandra, but people call me Alex or Ale, which is pronunce "ah-leh" in Spanish.
In this post I will take about myself and my journey to become a Data Analyst.
I have a background in Marine Biology, and it was during the last year of my bachelor studies where my interest in Data Analysis sparked. We learnt about statistics and how to analyse biological data. As I conducted research for my honours thesis I started developing my skill in R programming. 

I followed the research path, and decided to pursue a PhD in visual ecology at the University of Queensland, in Australia, where I grow my data analysis, statistics, data visualisation, and R programming skills even further.

I loved doing marine biology research in Australia, it was truly a privilege. I explored wunderfull places during my studies and met amazing people; however, sometimes unexpected things happen, such as the COVID-pandemic, and the plans you had can change witouth anticipation. 

I moved back to my home country, Mexico, and I started all over. I knew that as much as I loved doing research, it was not something I wanted to do for the rest of my career. Nonetheless, I needed a job, and I was lucky enough to take only three months to start as a teacher in a private high school.
